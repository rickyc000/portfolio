          In my previous role working for a music-focused e-commerce platform, I was able to combine my love of music with a unique opportunity to help artists connect with their fans. Working closely with talented developers on a daily basis sparked my interest in software engineering which led me to studying full-time at General Assembly.{'\n'}
